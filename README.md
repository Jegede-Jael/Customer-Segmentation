### Project Overview
---
This project aims to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset with the use of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Through the use of statistical methods and data visualization tools, we hope to pinpoint important factors influencing consumer behavior, 
efficiently divide up the target market, and draw attention to chances for tactical interaction. 
This makes it possible for companies to improve customer experiences, optimize marketing campaigns, and more precisely categorize their clientele.

### Data Source 
---
marketing_data1: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'marketing_data.csv' containing detailed information about the customer behaviour. 

### Tools
---
- SQL: Data cleaning and Analysis
- Power Bi: Data Visualization 

### Data cleaning 
---

In the initial data preparation phase, we:
- Data loading and inspection 
- Handling of duplicate and null values 
- Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
---

EDA involved exploring the marketing data to answer key questions, such as; 
1. What is the total sales and income of the company?
2. Who are the high-value customers?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with  
```SQL
select * from marketing_data1;
```
### Results/Findings 
---

The various results gotten from the analysis are summarized as follows 
- The data set contains a total of 2,216 customers with a total income of $114,68k and total sales of $1,345,28k.
- Age Group: Boomers and Gen X drive over 80% of total sales, positioning them as the most valuable segments.
